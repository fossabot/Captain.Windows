> Default built-in plugin for [Captain](https://github.com/CaptainApp/Captain)

## What's this?
[Captain](https://github.com/CaptainApp/Captain) is an extensible tray app that acts as a foundation for implementing
custom screen capturers.

This is the only plugin included by default, which implements basic output streams (clipboard and file) and encoders.
