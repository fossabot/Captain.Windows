> **Cyanogen Shared Code** - Header files common to native libraries used by [Captain](https://github.com/CaptainApp/Captain).


## What's this?
Just a bunch of header files that are shared by the diverse native projects required for Captain to properly function.

## Why *cn2*?
Originally, Captain used C++/CLI libraries for mixing native and managed code, but in favour of portability these libraries have been superseeded by pure native ones.
These *revamped* libraries are part of the *Captain Native Support Libraries Version 2*.
