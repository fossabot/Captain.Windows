## What's this?
In order to support certain Captain features (i.e. displaying capture HUD on fullscreen DirectX applications, or
attaching windows to Captain), we need to execute code in remote processes. To achieve this, a DLL is injected onto the
 target process, which modifies its behaviour.

## Why *cn2*?
Originally, Captain used C++/CLI libraries for mixing native and managed code, but in favour of portability these
libraries have been superseeded by pure native ones. These *revamped* libraries are part of the *Captain Native Support
Libraries Version 2*.
