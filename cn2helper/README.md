> **Cyanogen Helper Utility Library** - Contains native routines used by [Captain.Application](https://github.com/CaptainApp/Captain.Application)

## What's this?
These are a set of utility routines used by [Captain.Application](https://github.com/CaptainApp/Captain.Application) UI.

## Why *cn2*?
Originally, Captain used C++/CLI libraries for mixing native and managed code, but in favour of portability these libraries have been superseeded by pure native ones.
These *revamped* libraries are part of the *Captain Native Support Libraries Version 2*.
