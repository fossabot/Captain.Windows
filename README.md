> The minimal, extensible screen capturer.

ðŸš§ **This is an ongoing project under active development, and is not yet meant to be usable.** ðŸš§

Expect this repository to introduce **lots** of breaking changes with each commit and not to comply with open-source
licenses of its dependencies (i.e. credits to original authors of libraries and code used in this software may not be
added until a release candidate.)

## What's this?
Captain is an extensible screen capturing app that Just Worksâ„¢ (on Windows).
It is intended to take screenshots and record video from your screen and perhaps save captures to a file or upload them
to the Internet or whatever you'd like as long as there is a plugin for that (and if it's not go ahead and roll your own!)

Did I mention it ~~can~~ is meant to capture accelerated graphics such as those in games, fullscreen or not? Well it
~~might~~ might eventually do that, too.

## Building
```
$ git clone https://github.com/CaptainApp/Captain.Windows
$ cd Captain.Windows
$ nuget restore
$ devenv Captain.sln /Build
```

## What's with that version number?
~~The author likes pretending to have released a lots of versions for a product.~~
This app is actually the sucessor of [another application](https://github.com/sanlyx/cup) with the same concept made by
the same author.

This project results from the intent of providing the community a **functional** product, rather than some buggy,
unmaintained app tailored to personal usage.

## Extending Captain
Refer to the [Captain.Common](https://github.com/CaptainApp/Captain.Windows/Captain.Common) project tree.
There will be documentation, eventually.

## Contributing
_To-do :)_
