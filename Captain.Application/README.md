> Native GUI application that implements most of the [Captain](https://github.com/CaptainApp/Captain) logic.

## What's this?
It's the _actual_ code for [Captain](https://github.com/CaptainApp/Captain), an extensible screen capturing app.

## Why different repositories?
It's easier to organize the code this way.

## Open-source code
This app depends upon awesome open-source software without which it could not be possible.
