> **Cyanogen Windows 32-bit on Windows 64-bit Bridge** - Small internal utility for performing library injection on 32-bit processes under 64-bit platforms.

## What's this?
*See [issue #94](https://github.com/EasyHook/EasyHook/issues/94) for [EasyHook/EasyHook](https://github.com/EasyHook/EasyHook).*

When we need to inject native libraries onto remote 32-bit processes under 64-bit platforms, we can not do so directly from a 64-bit process (like [Captain.Application](https://github.com/CaptainApp/Captain.Application)).
In these cases, we call this little utility which handles the injection for us, and since it's a 32-bit process the injection can be performed just fine.

## Why *cn2*?
Originally, Captain used C++/CLI libraries for mixing native and managed code, but in favour of portability these libraries have been superseeded by pure native ones.
These *revamped* libraries are part of the *Captain Native Support Libraries Version 2*.
